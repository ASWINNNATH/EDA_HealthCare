**Healthcare Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains code and documentation for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset. The purpose of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset to gain insights and understand the underlying patterns and trends.

**Dataset Description:**
The healthcare dataset used in this project contains information about patients, including demographics, medical conditions, treatments, and outcomes. It includes both categorical and numerical variables, providing a comprehensive view of patient health and healthcare utilization.

**Objective:**
The main objective of this EDA project is to:
- Understand the distribution of variables within the dataset.
- Identify any missing or erroneous data and perform data cleaning.
- Explore relationships between different variables.
- Extract meaningful insights to inform decision-making in healthcare.

**Folder Structure:**
- **Code:** This directory contains Python scripts used for data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
- **Data:** This directory stores the dataset used in the analysis. (Note: Due to confidentiality reasons, the actual dataset is not included in this repository.)
- **Documentation:** This directory includes documentation related to the project, such as this README file.

**Dependencies:**
The code in this project is written in Python and requires the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

**Instructions:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the 'Code' directory.
3. Execute the Python scripts in the following order:
   - data_preprocessing.py
   - data_visualization.py
   - data_analysis.py
4. Review the generated visualizations and analysis to gain insights into the healthcare dataset.
